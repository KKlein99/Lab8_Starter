1) I would select "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed". In this way we can easily detect where the problem is rather than spend plenty of time in order to detect the problem position. If we set it after all the work has done it may cause a series of change to produce bugs which is going to spend more time. 
2) No, that will be totally logic check which we should finish while coding.
3) I would not use unit test for message. Because unit test involves testing individual parts of your code in encapsulated units to make sure each part of your code is functioning as it should. While, the message is feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user. It is not encapsulated units since it is the interaction of users.
4) Yeah i would use a unit test to test the max message length of a messaging application since it is totally belong to message.
